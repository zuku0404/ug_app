# Application Overview

This Java application is designed to convert the cost of computers purchased in USD to PLN based on the exchange rate provided by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) REST API for a specific date. The result is saved in an XML file and in a database. The application also allows querying and displaying data from the saved database in a user-friendly format.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API at:
* Without Docker: http://127.0.0.1:8081/home-page.html
* With Docker: http://127.0.0.1:5500/home-page.html

The frontend allows users to search for orders by product name; however, the search is case-sensitive. Additionally, users can filter orders by posting date. Sorting is available by product name and posting date.
Please note: if the user chooses to filter by date, the sorting option by date becomes hidden and unavailable to avoid conflicting filters.

If you run application by docker you can find file faktura.xml which is automatically generate when you start application to use commands 
        ```bash
            docker exec -it spring-backend /bin/bash
        ```
        ```bash
            cat faktura.xml
        ```
Without docker you can find this file into currency folder.
